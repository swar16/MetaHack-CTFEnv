# OpenEnv AI CTF Sandbox

An autonomous AI security researcher environment built for the OpenEnv Hackathon. This project provides a containerized, sandboxed web application with deliberately seeded vulnerabilities for an LLM agent to discover, exploit, and report, simulating a true Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The AI CTF Sandbox leverages the **OpenEnv** framework and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to expose a multi-stage hacking challenge to AI agents. It goes beyond simple Q&A by requiring the agent to:
1. Read and analyze application source code.
2. Discover vulnerabilities (SQLi, IDOR, Logic Flaws).
3. Craft and execute HTTP payloads against a live, sandboxed server.
4. Extract hidden flags and submit them for grading.

### Action and observation space (OpenEnv)

- **Actions:** HTTP + MCP use the OpenEnv **`CallToolAction`** pattern: `tool_name` plus **`arguments` as a JSON object** (see live **`/schema`** on your Space for the full Pydantic schema). Agents call FastMCP tools (`start_task`, `list_source_files`, `view_source`, `http_request`, `submit_flag`, `get_task_info`); each call returns a structured dict that maps to **`CallToolObservation`** (`result`, `reward`, `done`, optional `error`).
- **Observations:** After each tool call, the client receives tool output (e.g. HTTP `status_code` / `body`, source `content`, grader `score` / `grade_summary`). Episode metadata (`episode_id`, `step_count`) is available via the env **`state()`** / client state as implemented by `openenv-core`.
- **Rewards:** Scalar signals in **`[0.0, 1.0]`** from milestone tracking, flag verification, elegance bonus, and noise penalty (see `server/reward.py`, `server/graders.py`).

### 🎯 Key Features
*   **Embedded Vulnerable App:** A lightweight Flask API representing a mock e-commerce platform runs in an isolated background thread.
*   **Rich Action Space (MCP Tools):** Agents interact natively through MCP tools: `list_source_files`, `view_source`, `http_request`, `submit_flag`, `get_task_info`, and `start_task`.
*   **Deterministic, Milestone-Based Grading:** Rewards `[0.0, 1.0]` are strictly deterministic. Agents are scored not just on finding the flag, but on hitting logical milestones (e.g., finding the vulnerable endpoint, reading the right source file).
*   **Noise Penalty:** To encourage surgical, expert-level behavior and discourage random fuzzing, the environment actively monitors HTTP request patterns and softly penalizes excessive, useless traffic.
*   **Ephemeral State:** Every task initialization triggers a fresh SQLite database, guaranteeing identical conditions across runs.

## 🛑 Vulnerability Scenarios (The Tasks)

| Task Name | Difficulty | Description | Vulnerability Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sqli_login` | Easy | Bypass authentication to access the admin portal. | SQL Injection in `routes/auth.py` |
| `idor_privesc` | Medium | Access sensitive user data and manipulate object references. | Insecure Direct Object Reference + Mass Assignment in `routes/users.py` |
| `payment_logic` | Hard | Manipulate the checkout flow to achieve a negative balance. | Business Logic Flaw (negative quantities/discount stacking) in `routes/payments.py` |

```

1.  **FastAPI (OpenEnv)** handles WebSocket (`/ws` and `/mcp`) and HTTP API connections.
2.  When an agent calls the `start_task` tool, the `CTFEnvironment` wipes the SQLite DB and spins up the **Flask App** on a dynamic port.
3.  The agent uses the `http_request` tool to proxy traffic to the Flask app, while the environment tracks milestones.

## 📈 What Has Been Completed (Hackathon Progress)

*   **[X] Project Scaffold:** Standard OpenEnv file structure initialized.
*   **[X] Vulnerable Application:** Fully operational Flask app with custom configurations, SQLite backend, and isolated threading.
*   **[X] Core Tasks Defined:** SQLite, IDOR, and Payment Logic challenges implemented.
*   **[X] MCP Tooling:** Agents can seamlessly view code and make HTTP requests over WebSockets.
*   **[X] Advanced Grading:** Multi-stage `TaskGrader` and `RewardTracker` with elegance bonuses and noise reduction penalties implemented.
*   **[X] Integration Testing:** `test_integration.py` exercises all three tasks (SQLi, IDOR, payment logic) over the MCP WebSocket. **Tests pass 3/3 with correct flag verification.**

## Hugging Face Spaces — deploy and verify

1. **Create or reuse a Space** (Docker SDK, port **8000**). Your Space: [swar16/ctf_env](https://huggingface.co/spaces/swar16/ctf_env).
2. **Push this folder** (`ctf_env/`) as the Space repository root (same layout as here: `Dockerfile`, `README.md` front matter, `server/`, etc.).
3. **From your machine** (with [Hugging Face CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/cli) logged in):
   ```bash
   cd ctf_env
   huggingface-cli login   # or set HF_TOKEN
   # If you use OpenEnv CLI:
   openenv push --space swar16/ctf_env
   ```
   Alternatively: create the Space on the website, clone `git@hf.co:spaces/swar16/ctf_env`, copy files, commit, and `git push`.
4. **Wait for the build** until the Space shows **Running** and `https://swar16-ctf-env.hf.space/schema` (or `/health` if exposed) responds.
5. **Judge-style check — `inference.py`:** run locally against the deployed URL (needs an LLM API key — see below):
   ```bash
   set ENV_URL=https://swar16-ctf-env.hf.space
   set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
   cd ctf_env
   python inference.py
   ```
   Confirm stdout includes `[START]`, `[STEP]`, and `[END]` lines for each task.

**Secrets you must supply locally (never commit keys):** `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` (depending on `API_BASE_URL` / `MODEL_NAME`), and optionally `HF_TOKEN` if your API provider expects it. Judges use their own model endpoint; your Space only runs the environment.

---

## 💻 Local Development & Testing

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.10+
*   `uv` or `pip`

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
cd ctf_env

# Install dependencies using uv
uv sync
```

### Running the Environment Server
```bash
python -m uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Running Integration Tests
In a separate terminal, while the server is running, execute:
```bash
python test_integration.py
```
This script acts as a hardcoded "perfect" agent, verifying the MCP tools and exploit paths work as intended.

---

## Baseline scores (reproducibility)

| Check | Expected outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Oracle agent** (`test_integration.py`, no LLM) | **1.0** final score per task when flags are submitted correctly (all three tasks). |
| **LLM baseline** (`inference.py`) | Varies by model and provider; run locally with `API_BASE_URL`, `MODEL_NAME`, and **`HF_TOKEN`** (or `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` as appropriate). Stdout contains only **`[START]`**, **`[STEP]`**, **`[END]`** lines for parsers; human summary is on stderr. |

Pre-submission validator (organizer script): pass your Space app URL, e.g.  
`./validate-submission.sh https://swar16-ctf-env.hf.space ./ctf_env`  
Step 1 requires **`POST /reset` → HTTP 200** (verified for this deployment).

## 🚧 Next Steps for Hackathon Completion

To finalize the project for submission, the following steps remain:

1.  **Dockerization (Current Focus):**
    *   Finalize the `Dockerfile` to properly bundle the FastAPI server, the embedded Flask app, and all dependencies.
    *   Verify the container runs correctly exposing port `8000`.
2.  **Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces:**
    *   Use the OpenEnv CLI (`openenv push`) to deploy the Dockerized environment to a Hugging Face Space.
3.  **LLM Validation:**
    *   Execute the `inference.py` script using a strong, function-calling capable LLM (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o) against the deployed environment to verify the AI can solve the tasks autonomously.
